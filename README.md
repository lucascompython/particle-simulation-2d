# 2D Particle Simulation
This project is built with [`Zig`](https://ziglang.org/), [`SDL3`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL), [`Dawn`](https://github.com/google/dawn) / [`Wgpu-Native`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native) and [`ImGui`](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

This project is a rewrite of [this project](https://github.com/lucascompython/particles) that used Raylib and performed all the calculations on the CPU.

I'm making this project with the goal of learning modern graphics programming and the differences between graphics library stacks.

A 3D version of this simulation that uses [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) + [`Winit`](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) + [`Wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) + [`Egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui), can be found [here](https://github.com/lucascompython/particle-simulation-3d).
