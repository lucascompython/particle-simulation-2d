# 2D Particle Simulation
This project uses `SDL3`, `Dawn/Wgpu-Native` and `ImGui`.

This project is a rewrite of [this project](https://github.com/lucascompython/particles) that used Raylib and performed all the calculations on the CPU.

I'm making this project with the goal of learning graphics programming and the differences between graphics library stacks.

A 3D version of this simulation that uses `Rust` + `Winit` + `Wgpu` + `Egui`, can be found [here](https://github.com/lucascompython/particle-simulation-3d).
